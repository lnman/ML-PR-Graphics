# ML-PR-Graphics
This is my level-4 term-2 code.C++ is used to speed things up. In my 1.6GHz core-i5 laptop optimized Naive Bayes took 2s and threaded KNN took 20s.

###### C++ Build Information
Most of the codes requires recent version of g++. MINGW 4.9.3 is enough.

Standard build arguments should be: **_`g++ -std=c++11 -O4 -Wall *.cpp`_** . For threaded code use: **_`-lpthread`_** .

###### Python code running
I used python to visualize kmeans output. _Numpy,Scipy,MatPlotLib_ may be needed.
